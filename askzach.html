      <p class="question"> Q: Zach,
You don't know me but you know my associate, a small Asian boy named Shinta. Anyways, here is a problem. A tube of uranium oxide has a pressure of 666 atm, at -273.15 K, in a 420 mL container. If the size of the container is shrunken to 21 mL, and the temperature rises to 1134 degrees celcius, what is the new pressure in atm?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Admittedly, I don't know much about physics. But I do know a thing or two about psychics. So Iâ€™d have to say that the answer to your question depends on whether the container is wearing a tinfoil hat or not. If so, mindreading is impossible and the answer is indeterminate by unconventional means. If not, you can read the mind of the gas to determine pressure, but the act of mindreading tends to increase pressure on the mindreadee, so be quick about it.

      <p class="question"> Q: How does it feel to live in the shadow of your clearly cooler brother, Chase Westhoff? </p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Some plants thrive in the shade. And some wilt, weep, and wail. I'm somewhere in between. His shadow shields me from the blinding sun of expectations that would sear and stunt my tender mind, but also brings the bitter chill of resentment that I can't shake from my very marrow. It consumes me, driving me to lower and lower depths of depravity in my thirst to prove my independence. Unable to slake my thirst, I instead deny it, cozying up lovingly to my brother dear as if everything is alright, only to find that the heat of his frame is unable to warm the iciness his success has brought to my soul. Tortured by this struggle with the wickedness and pride that dwells within me, it is all I can do to fake a smile and pass my days plotting, ever plotting... Some day I will rise up and claim the brilliant daylight that is rightfully mine... There will come a time when he will be cast into shadow to contemplate the hades he has put me through, and I will feast on schadenfreude... Wait, what was the question again? Oh yeah, how it is living in Chase's shadow. It's alright. I kinda like it, actually.

 <p class="question"> Q: Hey Zach how do you peel a carrot?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: In my experience, the most efficient way is to find a hole that is just a bit too small for the carrot to fit through, and then force it through anyways. You even get a little carrot juice on the side if you do it right. An alternative method involves taking advantage of the fact that carrots are used to living in the ground. If you bury a carrot in flour, it will feel at home and will soon fall asleep in the soft powder. It will begin to dream of walking along tight ropes, swinging trapeze, and all other circus tricks that all carrots aspire to perform. At this moment-and it's critical that you strike just as the crowd in the carrot's dream is beginning to applaud a nearly-completed stunt-throw the carrot as high as you can into the air. Still half asleep, it will dream to its horror and humiliation that it is falling to its doom in front of a crowd of shocked once-admirers. This will startle the carrot awake, when it will then realize that it is indeed falling to its doom. Hit with such a one-two punch of terror, the carrot will be scared skinless and will be an excellent addition to any cuisine. Happy cooking!

 <p class="question"> Q:
       Zach, give me the honest truth: <br>
 - Why is abbreviation such a long word?<br>
 - And why is long such a short word??<br>
 - And for goodness' sake, why is short longer than long?! <br>
Why Zach, WHY?!? </p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Well, I imagine that by the time humanity had enough stuff to say to need the word "abbreviation," all the short words were taken. I was young in those days, but if I recall, the suggestion that we just call them "A" (for "abbreviation") was shot down pretty quick on the grounds that it would be too easily confused with the article. In fact, it was at that same council that the words for short and long were decided.  I believe the rationale was more based on the languid-sounding phonemes in long and the rather curt-sounding ones in short than on the spelling. My suggestion was that we show length of objects by stretching out the vowels' sounds. For example, a run-of-the-mill Oscar Mayer would be a "hot dog," while the Costco monsters would be "hooot dooogs," at least from the perspective of toddlers going shopping with their moms. The subjectivity of it all is what really put the nail in that proposal's coffin.

        <p class="question"> Q: Zach,<br> 
       What are the pros and cons of having pink hair? Would you recommend it?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: The pros and cons lists are eerily similar, now that I think of it. I guess it just comes down to values. Here are key points to consider. <br>
Pros: Extremely easy to be spotted in a crowd. Faeries may mistake you for one of their own. Children may fail to distinguish your hair from cotton candy. <br>
Cons: Extremely easy to be spotted in a crowd. Faeries may mistake you for one of their own. Children may fail to distinguish your hair from cotton candy. <br>
My recommendation? Live a wholesome and fulfilling life, seeking to better yourself and bring joy to those around you through love and compassionate service.

      <p class="question"> Q: Zach,<br> 
       Do you brush your teeth in the mountains often? If so, please send more pictures of you doing this.</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: There is an ancient Japanese proverb, taught to me in the mountains of Shikoku by a wanderer endeavoring to complete the Pilgrimage of Eighty Eight Temples in reverse. He entrusted me with its wisdom in exchange for the stylish watch I proffered him from the fog; to this day I consider it one of the best trades I ever conducted. The proverb goes thusly: <i> yamahamigaki wa hindo oshiezu shashin watasazu.</i> It roughly translates as follows: as for brushing one's teeth in the mountains, neither tell the frequency nor relinquish photographs. <br>
      I intend to live my life by this code of honor.

<p class="question"> Q: Zachary,<br> 
      What are "hazy watch offers?" And why are they an anagram for your name?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Imagine you're walking down a city street. It's twilight, and you are beginning to feel as if you shouldn't be out in that part of town as it grows late, especially with your wrist so bare. A man rappels down from the third floor of a candy shop that you hadn't noticed was there, and mist sets in as he calls out your name in the dusk. He speaks as if he is from a distant land, and yet you can't help but feel that it is you who is out of place. Just as you are feeling more comfortable than you ever would have expected, he surprises you with an out-of-this-world deal on an attractive timepiece and sinks into the pavement. You catch a whiff of ocean, and are left feeling as if you have been in the presence of dear friends for a great while. You spend hours in a pleasant daze, reflecting on all the things you have seen, heard, felt, and imagined. Then you are beset upon by common street thugs who rob you of your possessions and leave your injured body in a dumpster until a passerby gets you medical attention. When the police question you about the incident, all that passes your lips is tales of wonder, delight, and a mysterious man who offered you a watch in the haze. That man was me. My way of life compromised by the manhunt that ensued, I am forced to go into hiding, eking out a living answering questions on <a href="http://104.236.159.146/index.html">chasewesthoff.com</a> and choosing a name in sweet remembrance of my former occupation. I hope that clears things up, and I sincerely hope you're happy now. While you may have unintentionally ruined my life, changing my entire existence was worth it for the moment we shared. I love you. <br> -Zach</p>

      <p class="question"> Q: Dear Zach,<br> 
        Why aren't palm trees called coconut trees?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Way back in the days before people needed to eat, everyone was way into comparing hand sizes. When a male would have to defend his position as chief against a large-handed challenger who hoped to seize his tribe, there was only one way to settle the issue. The challenger and chief would make haste to a nearby tree and grasp the husks of progressively larger coconuts using only a single hand. Whoever could palm the larger coconut was crowned the chief. Some of these competitions drew quite the crowd, and the events were so captivating that the memory burned into spectators' minds was always related more to handspans than to large hard-shelled oval nuts. Thus, the trees present in the backdrop of those memories became known as "palm" trees. Hope that clears things up. <br> -Zach</p>

          <p class="answer"> A: Oh boy, that's a flurry of questions. Take a chill pill, Little Miss Blitzkrieg. And take a seat in a cozy armchair while I answer all your questions.<br>

        <p class="question"> Q: Is it worth my time to pick up a penny off the ground?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Assuming it takes five seconds to notice a penny, decide to pick it up, perform the action, and then carry on your way, this means you would be earning money at a rate of $7.20/hr as you relieve the ground of old Honest Abe. By this logic, it is completely rational to pick up a penny from the ground if your time is worth less to you than that. However, this consumption decision is further complicated by the inconvenience of having to carry and presumably use a penny at some point in the future. Personally, I derive utility from not having a penny on my person at any given time, and so I seldom pick them up from the ground; when I do, I think of it as a public service. One time I found like ten bucks on the ground, though, and that was pretty sweet. Candy for days, yo. Candy for days. <br>

      <p class="question"> Q: What is the meaning of life? Is it to throw myself into the void (my singles ward) or is there a light at the end of the tunnel? </p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Life is learning to <i>embrace</i> the void, my friend. (And also the most compatible person in your singles ward.) You must be the light in the void, and illuminate the tunnels of your fellow travelers. Or, like, eat pizza and stuff. Whatever floats your boat, really. <br>-Zach</p>

      <p class="question"> Q: What happens when you get scared "half to death" twice? 

      <br>Sincerely,

      <br>Pancho</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: You'll be left a quarter alive, of course. Once more and you'll be an eighth alive. Mathematically speaking, you'll never truly die from this, but you will soon be left a husk of your former self-a mere shell now composed (1 - (1/2n) of fear, where n is the number of times you have been scared half to death. <br>-Zach</p>


      <p class="question"> Editor's note: On the plus side, due to the nature of (1 - (1/2n)), one can't really be scared to death 0 times, so you won't ever be composed of negative infinity fear units, I guess? Negative infinity sounds dangerous. </p>

      <p class="question"> Q: Dear Zach, <br>would you consider yourself an expert at making cookies?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: For those of you who don't know me, I'm Zach and I make cookies about every week. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines "expert" as "having, involving, or displaying special skill or knowledge derived from training or experience." When the bishop asked me to speak on this topic, I was really nervous. But when I think about it, there's really only one expert at making cookies, whose example we should all strive to follow: my mom. <br>-Zach</p>

      <p class="question"> Q: Zach, what is the best way to watch Anime if I don't speak Japanese?
      <br>-UnicornGundamHero8</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Find a local yuppie who watches a lot of anime. They'll tell you they speak Japanese. "I'm self taught," they'll say. By this they mean they watch a lot of anime. Then they'll suggest in a holier-than-thou tone of voice that if you can't speak Japanese you should watch subs rather than dubs, though many of the nuances will be lost on you. When you reach this point, clap that person on the shoulder while giving them a firm handshake and making appreciative eye contact. This charitable donation of your time will inflate their self-worth and help them keep the darkness within at bay for another day. You are then free to walk away and do whatever you would like that will help you enjoy your life. Cheers, mate.<br> -Zach</p>

      <p class="question"> Q: Dear Zach,<br> my roommate designs this website that he believes is "the next Google, but slower and less exciting."  He is obsessed with his website, and spends all his free time tinkering.  He says he found an old strand of code from a fossilized computer and he's using today's technology to bring it back to life.  But do you think he should, just because he can?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Ah, your friend is so preoccupied with whether or not he can, he isn't stopping to think if he sh-...an? Whatever the parallel, I'm sure he'll be fine and everyone will be perfectly safe. I'd even go so far as to suggest he open up an amusement park around his discovery! Keep some camera crews around for good measure; things might get exciting. <br>-Zach</p>

       <p class="question"> Q: Dear Zach,<br>
      When will we be seeing the arrival of zachwesthoff.com? Chasewesthoff.com is pretty sweet but I think perhaps it needs a companion. </p>


        
      <p class="answer"> A: An excellent question! Keep this on the down-low, but it actually exists already, <a href="http://westhoff.net/zachary/"> in a sense</a>. But it's less of a companion and more of a progenitor, the brainchild of John Leslie Westhoff II. Chase's apple hasn't fallen far from the tree, and his website is a hilarious chip off the old block.

      Actually, yes. I can make bread. Several varieties. Though come to think of it, I've never tried making banana bread. I guess I've just never quite known how to remove the outside part of the banana. Your name seems to suggest that you'd be able to help with that. Hit me up sometime.

        <p class="question"> Q:  Dear Zach,<br>
      You seem like the kind of person that is so very wise and can be trusted. I'm going though a hard time in my current situation and could use some council. I am staying in an apartment complex and my neighbors tend to be very noisy in the late hours of the night. I have many early morning classes and sometimes I even have tests the next day. How can I deal with this trial?</p>

       
      <p class="answer"> A:  Dear Sleepless in Seattle,<br>
        Aww, you flatter me. Y'know, I think yours is a common problem. Have you tried writing some passive-aggressive texts to the perpetrators? If not, don't. As they say, if you can't beat 'em, party even harder than they do until they join you. Which is essentially the same as beating them, now that I think of it. But when it comes to sleeping-have you tried using earplugs? They're more effective than a broomstick and cheaper than a lawsuit. Best of luck!

      <p class="question"> Q: How do I talk to girls? </p>

       
      <p class="answer"> A: Dear Fearer of the Fairer Sex,<br>

      For this kind of anxiety, people often suggest imagining the audience in their underwear. Or maybe that's anxiety over public speaking? Whatever the case, I can't help but imagine that that would only serve to exacerbate the problem in your situation.

      Have you tried using words? If successful with that step, consider moving on to sentences. You never know what a good sentence will do for you. If blessed with a response, continue to exchange sentences until the desired outcome is attained. Should you find that you have said something reprehensible, just remember-nobody thinks you sounded as stupid and vile as you do.

      However, in extreme cases, it may be good to remember that that principle doesn't always apply to a jury of your peers. Best of luck, and keep out of trouble!
