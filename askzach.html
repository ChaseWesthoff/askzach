<p class="question"> Q: Zachary,<br> 
      What are "hazy watch offers?" And why are they an anagram for your name?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Imagine you're walking down a city street. It's twilight, and you are beginning to feel as if you shouldn't be out in that part of town as it grows late, especially with your wrist so bare. A man rappels down from the third floor of a candy shop that you hadn't noticed was there, and mist sets in as he calls out your name in the dusk. He speaks as if he is from a distant land, and yet you can't help but feel that it is you who is out of place. Just as you are feeling more comfortable than you ever would have expected, he surprises you with an out-of-this-world deal on an attractive timepiece and sinks into the pavement. You catch a whiff of ocean, and are left feeling as if you have been in the presence of dear friends for a great while. You spend hours in a pleasant daze, reflecting on all the things you have seen, heard, felt, and imagined. Then you are beset upon by common street thugs who rob you of your possessions and leave your injured body in a dumpster until a passerby gets you medical attention. When the police question you about the incident, all that passes your lips is tales of wonder, delight, and a mysterious man who offered you a watch in the haze. That man was me. My way of life compromised by the manhunt that ensued, I am forced to go into hiding, eking out a living answering questions on <a href="http://104.236.159.146/index.html">chasewesthoff.com</a> and choosing a name in sweet remembrance of my former occupation. I hope that clears things up, and I sincerely hope you're happy now. While you may have unintentionally ruined my life, changing my entire existence was worth it for the moment we shared. I love you. <br> -Zach</p>

      <p class="question"> Q: Dear Zach,<br> 
        Why aren't palm trees called coconut trees?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Way back in the days before people needed to eat, everyone was way into comparing hand sizes. When a male would have to defend his position as chief against a large-handed challenger who hoped to seize his tribe, there was only one way to settle the issue. The challenger and chief would make haste to a nearby tree and grasp the husks of progressively larger coconuts using only a single hand. Whoever could palm the larger coconut was crowned the chief. Some of these competitions drew quite the crowd, and the events were so captivating that the memory burned into spectators' minds was always related more to handspans than to large hard-shelled oval nuts. Thus, the trees present in the backdrop of those memories became known as "palm" trees. Hope that clears things up. <br> -Zach</p>

    <p class="question"> Q: At a movie theater which arm rest is yours? <br>
If an ambulance is on its way to save someone, and it runs someone over, does it stop to help them?<br>
Do vegetarians eat animal crackers?<br>
If a jogger runs at the speed of sound, can he still hear his iPod?<br>
How do you handcuff a one-armed man?<br>
When does it stop being partly cloudy and start being partly sunny?<br>
If God sneezes, what should you say? <br>
If a bunch of cats jump on top of each other, is it still called a dog pile?<br>
In the song Yankee Doodle, is he calling the horse or the feather "macaroni"? <br>
If ghosts can walk through walls and glide down stairs, why don't they fall through the floor?<br> 
These are the questions that haunt me as I lay in bed. Please help appease my troubled mind.
<br> -Nearly Asleep Norville</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Oh boy, that's a flurry of questions. Take a chill pill, Little Miss Blitzkrieg. And take a seat in a cozy armchair while I answer all your questions.<br>
The right one, where right is defined as correct. Good luck, it's anarchy.<br>
I'm pretty sure they just deploy a smaller ambulance from the original, like Russian nesting dolls. Your tax dollars at work.<br>
Depends on the species of vegetarian.<br>
He can unless it's a slow song.<br>
A bracelet so stylish he can't stop looking at it.<br>

No, it's called a worthy cat-alyst for changing your lifestyle and offloading some of your feline friends.<br>

        <p class="question"> Q: Is it worth my time to pick up a penny off the ground?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Assuming it takes five seconds to notice a penny, decide to pick it up, perform the action, and then carry on your way, this means you would be earning money at a rate of $7.20/hr as you relieve the ground of old Honest Abe. By this logic, it is completely rational to pick up a penny from the ground if your time is worth less to you than that. However, this consumption decision is further complicated by the inconvenience of having to carry and presumably use a penny at some point in the future. Personally, I derive utility from not having a penny on my person at any given time, and so I seldom pick them up from the ground; when I do, I think of it as a public service. One time I found like ten bucks on the ground, though, and that was pretty sweet. Candy for days, yo. Candy for days. <br>

      <p class="question"> Q: What is the meaning of life? Is it to throw myself into the void (my singles ward) or is there a light at the end of the tunnel? </p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Life is learning to <i>embrace</i> the void, my friend. (And also the most compatible person in your singles ward.) You must be the light in the void, and illuminate the tunnels of your fellow travelers. Or, like, eat pizza and stuff. Whatever floats your boat, really. <br>-Zach</p>

      <p class="question"> Q: What happens when you get scared "half to death" twice? 

      <br>Sincerely,

      <br>Pancho</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: You'll be left a quarter alive, of course. Once more and you'll be an eighth alive. Mathematically speaking, you'll never truly die from this, but you will soon be left a husk of your former self-a mere shell now composed (1 - (1/2n) of fear, where n is the number of times you have been scared half to death. <br>-Zach</p>


      <p class="question"> Editor's note: On the plus side, due to the nature of (1 - (1/2n)), one can't really be scared to death 0 times, so you won't ever be composed of negative infinity fear units, I guess? Negative infinity sounds dangerous. </p>

      <p class="question"> Q: Dear Zach, <br>would you consider yourself an expert at making cookies?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: For those of you who don't know me, I'm Zach and I make cookies about every week. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines "expert" as "having, involving, or displaying special skill or knowledge derived from training or experience." When the bishop asked me to speak on this topic, I was really nervous. But when I think about it, there's really only one expert at making cookies, whose example we should all strive to follow: my mom. <br>-Zach</p>

      <p class="question"> Q: Zach, what is the best way to watch Anime if I don't speak Japanese?
      <br>-UnicornGundamHero8</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Find a local yuppie who watches a lot of anime. They'll tell you they speak Japanese. "I'm self taught," they'll say. By this they mean they watch a lot of anime. Then they'll suggest in a holier-than-thou tone of voice that if you can't speak Japanese you should watch subs rather than dubs, though many of the nuances will be lost on you. When you reach this point, clap that person on the shoulder while giving them a firm handshake and making appreciative eye contact. This charitable donation of your time will inflate their self-worth and help them keep the darkness within at bay for another day. You are then free to walk away and do whatever you would like that will help you enjoy your life. Cheers, mate.<br> -Zach</p>

      <p class="question"> Q: Dear Zach,<br> my roommate designs this website that he believes is "the next Google, but slower and less exciting."  He is obsessed with his website, and spends all his free time tinkering.  He says he found an old strand of code from a fossilized computer and he's using today's technology to bring it back to life.  But do you think he should, just because he can?</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: Ah, your friend is so preoccupied with whether or not he can, he isn't stopping to think if he sh-...an? Whatever the parallel, I'm sure he'll be fine and everyone will be perfectly safe. I'd even go so far as to suggest he open up an amusement park around his discovery! Keep some camera crews around for good measure; things might get exciting. <br>-Zach</p>

       <p class="question"> Q: If you ate yourself, would you remain the same size or disappear??</p>

      <p class="answer"> A: When the great philosopher Plato was asked this question, he replied: "Heck if I know." Confucius, on the other hand, said: "Get a job, hippie." So there are multiple schools of thought on the subject.<br> -Zach</p>

       <p class="question"> Q: Dear Zach,<br>
      When will we be seeing the arrival of zachwesthoff.com? Chasewesthoff.com is pretty sweet but I think perhaps it needs a companion. </p>


        
      <p class="answer"> A: An excellent question! Keep this on the down-low, but it actually exists already, <a href="http://westhoff.net/zachary/"> in a sense</a>. But it's less of a companion and more of a progenitor, the brainchild of John Leslie Westhoff II. Chase's apple hasn't fallen far from the tree, and his website is a hilarious chip off the old block.
      Maybe someday I'll get back on that horse and ride.

      <p class="question"> Q: Does Chase get on your nerves much? </p>
      <p class="answer"> A: Anyone will get on your nerves at times when you've spent about nineteen years in close proximity. I count myself fortunate to have been in his company enough to occasionally want to punch him; the vast majority of our time together is taken with me slapping my own knee. Figuratively speaking, of course.

      <p class="question"> Q: Can you make bread? </p>

       
      <p class="answer"> A: Dear B Peeler,<br>

      Actually, yes. I can make bread. Several varieties. Though come to think of it, I've never tried making banana bread. I guess I've just never quite known how to remove the outside part of the banana. Your name seems to suggest that you'd be able to help with that. Hit me up sometime.

        <p class="question"> Q:  Dear Zach,<br>
      You seem like the kind of person that is so very wise and can be trusted. I'm going though a hard time in my current situation and could use some council. I am staying in an apartment complex and my neighbors tend to be very noisy in the late hours of the night. I have many early morning classes and sometimes I even have tests the next day. How can I deal with this trial?</p>

       
      <p class="answer"> A:  Dear Sleepless in Seattle,<br>
        Aww, you flatter me. Y'know, I think yours is a common problem. Have you tried writing some passive-aggressive texts to the perpetrators? If not, don't. As they say, if you can't beat 'em, party even harder than they do until they join you. Which is essentially the same as beating them, now that I think of it. But when it comes to sleeping-have you tried using earplugs? They're more effective than a broomstick and cheaper than a lawsuit. Best of luck!

      <hr>  
      <p class="question"> Q: How do I talk to girls? </p>

       
      <p class="answer"> A: Dear Fearer of the Fairer Sex,<br>

      For this kind of anxiety, people often suggest imagining the audience in their underwear. Or maybe that's anxiety over public speaking? Whatever the case, I can't help but imagine that that would only serve to exacerbate the problem in your situation.

      Have you tried using words? If successful with that step, consider moving on to sentences. You never know what a good sentence will do for you. If blessed with a response, continue to exchange sentences until the desired outcome is attained. Should you find that you have said something reprehensible, just remember-nobody thinks you sounded as stupid and vile as you do.

      However, in extreme cases, it may be good to remember that that principle doesn't always apply to a jury of your peers. Best of luck, and keep out of trouble!

      <p class="question"> Q: Hi Zach!<br>

      My mandolin is my only friend. How I improve my soloing over D mixolydian mode and a G blues scales?

      <p class="answer"> A: Dear Tormented Tortilla,<br>

      Ah, the age-old question. There's actually lots of helpful resources for this already up on the web. I recommend <a href="http://www.latlmes.com/music/record-record-breaking-jazz-solos-in-record-time-1"> this one </a> from the LA Times to start.
